# Snake: Grow or Shrink
## A version of Snake.io game that grows itself or shrinks based on what it eats
### This was a very fun project. I learned a lot of what pygame has to offer. At first I was having difficulty incorporating the poisonous food, which is suppose to shrink the snake if eaten. It would either not shrink the snake, go right through the food itself, or the game would crash at times. Nevertheless, I continued to think of fixes and eventually got it down. A list was created, which was updated everytime the snake ate something; it would either append or remove which represented the length of the snake. I added two foods to grow the snake and two poisonous food to avoid that will shrink the snake. The score also corresponds with the length of the snake. After completing the project, my vision now is to add another condition which is that every time the snake grows (eats a food), in additional poisonous food will be added, meaning that as your score and snake length increase, the game will become more difficult because the user will now have to avoid many more poisonous food (obstacles) in order so that their score and length arent decreased.
